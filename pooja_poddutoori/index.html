        <p>widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p><br>

          <p>The website offers 15 volumes, containing Albert Einstein's (1879–1955) works and letters from his early years until 1927, that have already been released by the editors of the Einstein Papers Project.</p>
          <p>The books are available in their original language form together with extensive annotations in English and other academic tools. The reader can also switch to an English translation of the majority of the texts.</p>
          <p>Readers may access each published document's archival record at the Einstein Archives Online and, in certain circumstances, the digitized manuscript by clicking on the special archival identifier number that appears beneath each paragraph. More than 8,000 distinct documents, including half that are provided here in full text, are included in these 15 volumes of the documentary edition and translation edition. The total page count is 18,000 pages.</p>
          <p>Following the first publishing of the first book in the series, the website will provide the following volumes.</p>

                    "In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass–energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.

                    Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.
